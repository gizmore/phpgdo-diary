<h1>Access Denied</h1>
<p>To protect a beloved soul, the access to my diary has been denied.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything my little gem. I will never forget you, and i am sorry that you made me find myself and that i cannot take you with me at the moment.</p>
<p>Maybe one day you could move here. But only the wind knows what will happen to us.</p>
<p>In the end, you were a way better teacher than myself.</p>
<p>I know that i took a lot from you, but i also gave you back a lot.</p>
<p>Sad times.</p>
<br/>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Christian, a.k.a. gizmore</p>
